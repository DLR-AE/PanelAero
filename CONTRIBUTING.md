# Providing a contribution
1. Clone or fork the project.
2. Create a new branch feature_xy, fix_xy
3. Extend the code.
4. Make sure that the examples still work properly (in the DLR GitLab, pytest triggered by the CI pipeline may not fail) and provide new examples for added features.
5. Create a merge request into the devel branch.
